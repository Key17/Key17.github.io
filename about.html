            <h4>as I'm learning english</h4>
            <p>I'm learning english by my self, and I say learning intead learned, because always when I talk with friends in english or a watch a movie or series, I learn something new. <br>
               Well, I started to learn it one and half year ago, I began with youtube videos, readding news on CNN, and six months ago I started to watch movies and series in english and talk with Native speakers who I knew on social medias. <br>
               It wasn't easy 'cause I had to push me away from have fun many times, so It made me learn when work and when have fun. And that's really good or I think so.
