                <h2 class="sub">High School and How am I learning english?</h2>
                <h3>High School</h3>
                <p>Well I'm good studying, I got Graduated as the better Student Where I studied, and with a Honnor for the better Company project. <br>
                   I made many friends, and I keep contact with some teachers.
                </p>
                <h3>as I'm learning english</h3>
                <p>I'm learning english by my self, and I say learning intead learned, because always when I talk with friends in english or when I watch movies or series, I learn something new. <br>
                   Well, I started to learn it one and half year ago, I began with youtube videos, readding news on CNN, and six months ago I started to watch movies and series in english and talk with Native speakers who I knew on social medias. <br>
                   It wasn't easy 'cause I had to push me away from have fun many times, so It made me learn when work and when have fun. And that's really good or I think so.
